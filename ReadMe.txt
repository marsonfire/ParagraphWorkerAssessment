The following program is broken down into two separate files - Program.cs and ParagraphWorker.cs. Program.cs prompts the user for an input paragraph, which will then have four different kinds of analysis performed on it. The results of this analysis are output to the console. ParagraphWorker.cs is the class that performs this analysis. 

1. The first job is to count the number of palindromes in the given input paragraph. Palindromes are words that are the same forwards as they are backwards. For example, "pop" is the same when spelt backwards. After receiving the input, the number of palindromes and which words they are will be shown in the console.

2. The second job counts the number of palindrome sentences in the given input paragraph. In this case, the whole sentence is the same forwards as it is backwards. After receiving the input, the number of palindromes and which sentences are palindromes will be shown in the console.

3. The third job lists each unique word, and how many times that word shows up in the given paragraph. The results are output to the console.

4. The fourth job requires a letter to be given by the user. Each word in the input paragraph will be searched for this letter, and if it contains the letter, it will be output to the console. 

After each job has been completed, the user will be prompted if they would like to go through another example.
